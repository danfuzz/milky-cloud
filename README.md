Milky Cloud
===========

This is a set of "cloud computing" utilities, mostly written for my (danfuzz's)
personal use, and 99% about doing small-scale work in AWS EC2.

The dependencies are intentionally minimal:
* POSIX-friendly OS (observed working on Linux and macOS)
* Bash
* `jq`
* AWS's own CLI tool (which in turn requires some version of Python)
